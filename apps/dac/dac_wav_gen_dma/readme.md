# DAC waveform generation with DMA

This example application shows how to use the DAC with the DMA to generate a 5 KHz sinusoidal waveform without CPU intervention.

## Description

The DAC Peripheral library is used in hardware trigger mode to generate a Sine wave. The TC peripheral is configured to generate a trigger every two microseconds. Trigger is connected to the DAC using the EVSYS peripheral. DMA is used to setup a linked list to transfer sine wave samples from lookup table to the DAC "DATABUF" register. In this application, the number of DAC samples per cycle(0 to 360 degrees sine wave) is 100.
